Constant Listener

This repository was created as a utility for a home automation system. It listens in the background, and uses Google's Speech-to-Text API to give the text said through a Queue.

The general usage has it listening for overlapping chunks, so if you read the beginning of this README into the program, the Queue would have in it:
["Constant Listener", "Listener This repository was created", "story was created as a Ute", ...]


Initilization:

Put a valid Google Developer Key in the key.py file.

You will need to pass in a profile that is a dictionary. If you are using the google STT service, it needs to have 'key' mapped to a valid Google Developer's key.

Follow "Step 1" here: http://progfruits.wordpress.com/2014/05/31/using-google-speech-api-from-python/
(Also, concerns raised in the article are valid.)

If you are using sphinx, you need profile to have "words" mapped to a list of possible outputs.

Usage:

To start a listener that triggers every one second and records for 4 seconds (using google STT):

profile = { "key": "My_key_here" }
q = Queue.Queue()
background_speech_to_text(q, 4, 1, profile, "google")
