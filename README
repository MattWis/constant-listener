Constant Listener

This repository was created as a utility for a home automation system. It listens in the background, and uses Google's Speech-to-Text API to give the text said through a Queue.

The general usage has it listening for overlapping chunks, so if you read the beginning of this README into the program, the Queue would have in it:
["Constant Listener", "Listener This repository was created", "story was created as a Ute", ...]


Initilization:

Put a valid Google Developer Key in the key.py file.

Follow "Step 1" here: http://progfruits.wordpress.com/2014/05/31/using-google-speech-api-from-python/
(Also, concerns raised in the article are valid.)


Usage:

To start a listener that triggers every one second and records for 4 seconds:

q = Queue.Queue()
background_speech_to_text(q, 4, 1)
